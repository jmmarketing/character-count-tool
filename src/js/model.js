//Psuedo code:
/* What calculations and states need to be recognized and done:
- Is Exclude Spaces checked?
- Is there a Chracter limit? 
    -- Both of these could be passed as parameters with default set to false. 

- Total input (string) needs to be recieved. 
- Length = Characters (+/- spaces)
- Spaces = Word Count
- Periods = Sentence count. 
- Letter Density
    - Reduce over string and increase count based on letter (MDN has example i think). 

Out put should be one data object.
